.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool is used to remove a debian change set, that is, a debian .changes
file, and all it's associated debian packages, sources tarballs, etc.  This
is typically used to remove an older set of packages prior to copying a
newer set with deb-archive.  This takes a list of change files so you can
use wildcards to find and remove all changed versions of a specific package.
